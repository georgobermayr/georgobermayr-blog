Intro: Hey, for over 12 years this is my digital home. The place where I compile my thoughts and contribute to discussions. Today, I do what I’ve always done: I think, write, speak, consult, and, first and foremost, act at the epicenter of publishings constant disruption. Exiting times for media production. My current activities revolve around content infrastructure in a multichannel world, creating digital products with agile processes and what machine learning means for all of this. Join my digital logbook and contact me if you like—I’m always happy to chat with other fellows!
