Intro: Hey, for over 12 years this is my digital home. The place where I compile my thoughts and contribute to discussions. Today I do, what I’ve always done: I think, write, speak, consult, and, first and foremost, act at the epicenter of publishings constant disruption. Exiting times for media production. My current activities revolve around content infrastructure in a multichannel world, agile processes and what machine learning means for all of this. Join my digital logbook and contact me if you like—I’m always happy to chat with other fellows!
