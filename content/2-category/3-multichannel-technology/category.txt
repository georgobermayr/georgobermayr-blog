Title: Multichannel Technology

----

Description: The true craftsmanship of media production has always been the perfect welding of content and design. But today, this is obstructing progress. We need to free our content. We need to think of publishing as a platform. As something that acts as a lean service, not as a monolithic predesigned block. APIs could help transforming media production into something that is connectable and flexible. Enabling not just multichannel communication but also new freedom for designers and creativity.
