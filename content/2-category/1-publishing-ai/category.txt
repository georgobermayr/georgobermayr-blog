Description: There is no "I" in artificial intelligence. A machine doesn't know about itself, doesn't have consciousness. So the question about "machine creativity"?

But clearly something is happening: Machine learning tools are more and more aiding the design and marketing processes. This is no threat to human creativity—it is an opportunity.
